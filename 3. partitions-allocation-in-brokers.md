# Kafka Partitions allocation process

Kafka tries to allocate partitions evenly in the brokers but it tries to keep copy in differnt
machine for fault tolarace, for that purpose they do the order of the cluster of machine.

## Lets say we have 10 paritions of the topic with 3 replication factor , so we need to assign 10 * 3 = 30 replicas in the cluster

## So we first start with leader partitions assignment in the cluster , then we assign the followers , but for that we skip the first broker and assign the followers ,
same for the second follower as well.

Now if we check , we will see that if one machine goes down there must be one partition there alive, but note that
partition may not be assigned evenly in the every broker.
