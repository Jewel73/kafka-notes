# How Kafka Ensure No Data Loss?

Kafka paritition leader maintain a ISR list where it keeps all the followers that are in sync with the leader, if it is < 10 seconds
then it keept in the ISR list, so what if there is no follower in the ISR that means followers are not in sync? and our leader crush?
dont we loss data? Yes we do but to avoid data loss , we have a solution for that in two ways.

* Commited VS Uncommited
* Minimum IN-Sync Replicas

# Commited VS Uncommited
We can configumre leader not consider a message to be commited untill the message commited in all the ISR list. and uncommited message will lost if 
leader crush but producer can resent the message if they not get acknowledgement of the message after a timeout.

# Minimum In-Sync Replicas
Lets assume that our all followers goes down, so in our ISR list we have only leader , so if message commited in the leader our producer
get the success ack, but it is quite risky
