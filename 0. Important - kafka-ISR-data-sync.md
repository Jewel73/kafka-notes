# How Kafka Ensure No Data Loss? 

Kafka paritition leader maintain a ISR list where it keeps all the followers that are in sync with the leader, if it is < 10 seconds
then it keept in the ISR list, so what if there is no follower in the ISR that means followers are not in sync? and our leader crush?
dont we loss data? Yes we do but to avoid data loss , we have a solution for that in two ways.

* Commited VS Uncommited
* Minimum IN-Sync Replicas

# Commited VS Uncommited
We can configumre leader not consider a message to be commited untill the message commited in all the ISR list. and uncommited message will lost if 
leader crush but producer can resent the message if they not get acknowledgement of the message after a timeout.

# Minimum In-Sync Replicas
Lets assume that our all followers goes down, so in our ISR list we have only a leader partition, so if message commited in the leader our producer
get the success ack, but it is quite risky, what if leader goes down? and after some time follower again alive? then followers won't get the new
data that commited by the leader right? lets see a senerio to understand it better.

## Example :
Data Loss Scenario
Brokers A, B, and C manage 3 partitions with a replication factor of 3 in a Kafka cluster, with acks=all ensuring message durability. One day, Brokers B and C go down, leaving only Broker A to handle acknowledgments. The producer continues sending messages, which Broker A acknowledges. Suddenly, Broker A also fails. When Brokers B and C recover, they can't retrieve the latest data, leading to the loss of all messages written during their downtime. This highlights the critical need for maintaining broker health to prevent data loss.

So to avoid it we can set the Minimum In-Sync Replicas = 2, so that broker wont recieve data from producer if there is not in sync replica less than 2. but it will stil available for read operation.
